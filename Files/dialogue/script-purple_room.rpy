            y "As I said, there have been several variants produced for a variety of different situations and environments."
            y "The KM1000 is essentially just a KM2000 without the coating, leaving the blade a nice, non reflective silver. Good if you don't want to worry about the coating being damaged overtime, I suppose...but the coating is good for corrosive resistance. These are special use case knives, I believe."
            y "Going on from there, there's the KM3000, which abandons the tanto-style point in favor of an almost spear-like tip. An odd choice, I suppose. The tanto style tip was fairly iconic amongst the Kampfmesser brand."
            y "I'm sure it has its uses, but...well. I think my preference is known, yes? The tanto design allows the knife's tip to double as a pry bar due to the strength of the design...but, moving on from that..."
            y "Both of these have further variants with sand colored scabbards and grips. As you could probably guess, they're for use in desert environments; they saw some popularity in Afghanistan."
            y "I mentioned this before, but it seems like the knives themselves didn't change much for the hot environment..."
            y "There's also a KM4000. Eickhorn received requests from the German Armed Forces for further-expanded multi-functionality in their knives, and this was their response. It goes back to the tanto-style tip, but also includes a complete saw-back alongside an actual wire cutter!"
            y "All of these offshoots and variants born from a single knife. They're ultimately the same at heart, just with a few alterations."
            y "The blades themselves are comprised of Böhler N695. It's a particular type alloy designed to hold an edge better than previous 1.4110 steel. Though you could also find knives being produced with 1.4125..."
            y "Going further, the knives come in partially serrated or straight edge variants for a variety of use cases, depending on what you see yourself needing more. Many people opt for the partially serrated versions. Having a saw on hand is...well, handy."
            y "And before I forget, an interesting trait they all seem to share is located in the handle of the knife itself. In the bottom is a glass breaker tip; a solid lug of metal designed for exactly what it sounds like."
            y "It's actually the end of the knife blade! The knives are full tang; that is to say, one solid, complete piece of steel. In this situation, it feels like no part of the metal goes to waste!"
            y "The Kampfmesser family is incredibly diverse in their several approaches to what's essentially the same blade. I appreciate their work in making sure that there's a little something for everyone..."
        "It's okay, [persistent.yuri_nickname]. You don't have to go into a history lesson about every variation.":

            y "Quite. If I did, we'd be here for a while, I believe..."

label Kabar:
    y "Oh, yes, the famous USN Mark 2 Utility Knife. Many military enthusiasts know this blade well; you've almost certainly encountered it through some form of media."
    y "You may know it better by its contemporary name; The Ka-Bar!"
    y "A combat knife first adopted by the United States Marine Corp, and later the Navy. It first saw service in November of 1942, after Marines complained about their previous blade of choice, the Mark I trench knife..."
    y "It was designed both to be used for combat, but also as a tool. The environments many soldiers found themselves in proved to be much more amiable with this at their sides."
    y "There's a funny story about the trademark name KA-BAR I recall reading once."
    y "Apparently, the company that owns the trademark received a letter sometime in the 1920s from a fur trapper."
    y "The trapper claimed that he had used one of their blades to finish off a wounded bear that had assaulted him after his rifle had jammed."
    y "The letter was quite illegible, however; only fragments of the phrase 'kill a bear' could be read, which came out as 'ka bar'. The company found this to be high praise, as well as a great advertising point."
    y "As such, the brand 'KA-BAR' was established; a knife good enough to kill even a bear."
    y "Now, of course, this report leaves much to be discussed. Of course, the biggest question is; did it actually kill a bear?"
    y "Who knows? I'm certainly not about to find out...and I hope you aren't, either, [player]!"

    y "It's an almost comically large blade, going up to 30cm...that's to say, 12 inches in length."
    y "The history behind it is quite funny, too. It was originally made for a man named Jim Bowie for use in a duel."
    y "I believe the duel is known as the Sandbar Fight. Quite a sordid affair it ended up being..."
    y "It was less a 'duel' and more a brawl between a large number of participants. Guns were drawn, shots fired, and well..."
    y "The knife has a fascinating history, is the point of this all. Bowie even managed to win with the knife despite having been shot, stabbed, and nearly beaten to death."
    y "The blade itself carries along that same spirit of hardiness. You'd be hard pressed to find a situation in which this pretty number wouldn't help...be it through intimidation or force. How did that line go? 'That's not a knife...{i}THIS{/i} is a knife'?"
    y "Not that I'm saying you should go and pick fights! Or put yourself in a situation in which a fight could be picked to begin with!"
    y "No, no...please, be safe! Knife or no knife!"

    y "A 7-inch twisted blade made from 6AL-4V Titanium, with a grenade-like handle, which is also made from the same material."
    y "Regarding comfort and handling, it isn't the best, but the handle does give the user a solid grip."
    y "The blade is hollowed, which further enhances its menacing looks and reduces the overall weight of the dagger."
    y "The name comes from the Austrian Special Forces Operation group, and it lives up to its elite namesake."
    y "The dagger comes with a custom hard-coated 6061-T6 tubular sheath to protect the blade and the user, and has storage for a compass as well!"
    y "The very unique style of this knife intrigues me a lot, and I've read many things about its capabilities."
    y "Although, as you can see, [player], this is only a safe, dull knife, since the actual one is illegal in many countries."
    y "If there was someone who'd be unfortunate enough to be stabbed by it, no doctor could even stitch the penetrated area because of the twisted blades making a pyramid-shaped wound that, even if it was stitched from the surface, wouldn't staunch bleeding, thus making it an internal wound."
    y "Its sturdiness is top-notch, as well, therefore the durability and reliability sky-rocket to a very high point, and when combined with the grip it offers, you could even stab through bricks, if you're powerful enough."
    y "But, despite this only being a dull knife, I still like it for its aesthetics and overall appearance, not that I don't like my other knives, too...!"

label Bone:
    y "Have you ever read about knives made from bone? They've been used to create blades in many cultures, and not just in the distant past."
    y "I read a study recently about people in the Sepik region of New Guinea, who made them for use in battle as recently as the 1970s."
    y "There doesn't seem to be a special name for these weapons, so anthropologists are just calling them 'bone daggers.'"
    y "Many such pieces have elaborate patterns etched into them, but others are strictly utilitarian."
    y "What's especially fascinating is that the bones they're made from are acquired from two completely different sources."
    y "One is cassowaries, a very large type of flightless bird common to the area, and the second is... their own ancestors."
    y "According to scholars, the daggers of human origin were sourced from the femurs of men who had proven themselves in battle, often the warriors' own fathers, or other highly respected men in the community."
    y "Thus, taking a part of them with you into battle was seen as a way to add their strength to your own."
    y "As for cassowary daggers, the birds are rightly seen as powerful creatures—you can really see their dinosaur ancestry when you look at them!"
    y "Wielding a part of one is also thought to imbibe you with their strength, but the ones made of human bone are held in much higher regard."
    y "A study showed that while human and cassowary femurs are basically equal in strength, the process of carving them into blades is different depending on the source."
    y "Cassowary bones are shaved down more, making them thinner but consequently weaker. In contrast, human bones are cut to keep their natural curvature, resulting in a thicker but stronger blade, and feature decorative etching as well."
    y "I was actually lucky enough to acquire a bone dagger of my own! Oh, don't worry, it is from a cassowary, not a human. At least... that's what its plain appearance and overall thin profile point to it being."
    y "Although I did buy it online, so it's impossible to say for sure..."

label Filet:
    y "One of the first knives I ever bought for myself. It's actually a fillet knife, meant for filleting and preparing fish."

    y "It's not the highest quality, but it is still genuinely useful, unlike some others I bought."
    y "Many traditional Japanese dishes involve fish, so knowing how to debone them is a useful skill."
    y "The shape of this knife's handle is actually very practical, as you do not want to risk your fingers coming into accidental contact with the sharp blade if the job happens to get slippery."
    y "I was able to get Natsuki talking about cooking/baking once. It was quite enjoyable, up until I asked if she ever made healthy food. That... wasn't where I had intended the conversation to go."

label Butterfly:
    y "As you likely know, this is a folding knife, also known as a butterfly knife."
    y "In addition to its obvious use as a weapon, it makes a lovely multi-use tool; many professions all but require keeping one folded in your pocket."
    y "Consequently, I find butterfly knives are very often designed to be both beautiful and functional. I actually own more than one, but this is by far the most appealing."
    y "It originated in the Philippines and gained popularity worldwide due to its unique flipping and spinning techniques."
    y "Butterfly knives are often used for tricks, flipping, and display purposes rather than as practical cutting tools."
    y "While illegal in some jurisdictions due to safety concerns and association with criminal activities, butterfly knives are legal and widely collected in many places."

label Grater:

    y "I didn't realize what it was until I read the care instructions later!"
    y "While it's not uncommon in fiction to see full-sized swords with cutouts like this one, on the grounds that it makes the blade lighter, it's actually the opposite of practical in real life."
    y "Such a design only makes the blade significantly weaker."
    y "Real swords are actually much lighter than you might expect; contrary to what some movies would have you believe, they're not made by pouring molten metal into molds."
    y "Instead, the blades are formed by folding."
    y "This process involves heating the metal and then pounding it into shape, many times over, which removes impurities in the material and greatly strengthens the blade."
    y "It's truly an art form."
    y "Also, grater knives are essential tools in culinary tasks such as garnishing, baking, and adding flavor to dishes."
    y "They come in various sizes and styles, including handheld graters, box graters, and rotary graters."

    y "It's likely not coincidental that the kunai somewhat resembles a masonry trowel."
    y "In fiction, you see them used largely as throwing weapons, but from what I've read, they were more practical for stabbing or slashing."
    y "Another common use in media is climbing aids, stabbing them into a cliff or even a stone wall to scale it."
    y "As simple as the design is, the kunai is suited to many different functions. In terms of weaponry, the loop at the end allows them to be tied to poles as makeshift spears; the handle can also be wrapped to provide a better grip."
    y "Originally used as a farming implement for digging, planting, and prying, kunai knives later became associated with ninja warriors and popular culture."
    y "Kunai knives are known for their simple and utilitarian design, featuring a sturdy blade and a looped handle for improved grip and control."

    y "Historical Damascus steel was renowned for its exceptional strength, sharpness, and resilience, making it highly sought after for swords, knives, and other weapons."
    y "The unique patterning in Damascus steel is created through a process of layering and forging different types of steel alloys, resulting in a distinctive rippled or wavy appearance."
    y "Modern Damascus knives are crafted using pattern welding techniques that replicate the aesthetics of traditional Damascus steel."
    y "These knives are constructed from layers of high-carbon and low-carbon steel alloys, which are forge-welded and manipulated to create intricate patterns."
    y "The layering process not only enhances the visual appeal of the knife but also contributes to its strength, durability, and edge retention."
    y "Damascus knives are prized possessions among collectors, chefs, and knife enthusiasts for their craftsmanship, performance, and historical significance."
    y "The sharpness and durability of Damascus steel allow for precise and effortless cutting, making it a preferred choice among professional chefs and home cooks."
    y "Damascus knives are often used for preparing meats, vegetables, fruits, and other ingredients with precision and finesse."

    y "Saw knives may feature a fixed or folding blade design, with the serrated portion typically located near the handle for increased control and precision."
    y "The serrated edge allows for more aggressive cutting action compared to traditional knife edges, making saw knives ideal for tasks that require cutting through fibrous or hard materials."
    y "Folding saw knives are popular among outdoor enthusiasts for their portability and safety features, as the blade can be folded into the handle when not in use."
