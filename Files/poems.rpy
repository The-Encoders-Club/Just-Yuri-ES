It happened in the dead of night while I was slicing bread for a guilty snack.
My attention was caught by the scuttering of a raccoon outside my window.
That was, I believe, the first time I noticed my strange tendencies as an unordinary human.
I gave the raccoon a piece of bread, my subconscious well aware of the consequences.
Well aware that a raccoon that is fed will always come back for more.
The enticing beauty of my cutting knife was the symptom.
The bread, my hungry curiosity.
The raccoon, an urge.

The moon increments its phase and reflects that much more light off of my cutting knife.
The very same light that glistens in the eyes of my raccoon friend.
I slice the bread, fresh and soft. The raccoon becomes excited.
Or perhaps I'm merely projecting my emotions onto the newly-satisfied animal.

The raccoon has taken to following me.
You could say that we've gotten quite used to each other.
The raccoon becomes hungry more and more frequently, so my bread is always handy.
Every time I brandish my cutting knife, the raccoon shows me its excitement.
A rush of blood. Classic Pavlovian conditioning. I slice the bread.
And I feed myself again."""

A marvel millions of years in the making.
Where the womb of Earth chaotically meets the surface.
Under a clear blue sky, an expanse of bliss--
But beneath gray rolling clouds, an endless enigma.
The easiest world to get lost in

One can only build a sand castle where the sand is wet.
But where the sand is wet, the tide comes.
Will it gently lick at your foundations until you give in?
Or will a sudden wave send you crashing down in the blink of an eye?
Either way, the outcome is the same.
Yet we still build sand castles.

I stand where the foam wraps around my ankles.
Where my toes squish into the sand.
The salty air is therapeutic.
The breeze is gentle, yet powerful.
I sink my toes into the ultimate boundary line, tempted by the foamy tendrils.
Turn back, and I abandon my peace to erode at the shore.

He steps into the streetlight. I gasp and drop my umbrella.

The only indication of movement is the amber light flickering against his outstretched arm.
The flickering light is in rhythm with the pounding of my heart.
Teasing me for succumbing to this forbidden emotion.

Mind to matter, finger to key, letter to words:

Even as I prepare to type—I hesitate.

Below the regimented heading stretches a yawning expanse of white,

Tinged with the weary expectancy borne of a thousand trials past.

Still, ephemeral needles dart through the focal of idea and action,

Eager to weave. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be.

...

Fingers gaily waltz across the keyboard, bars of checkered ivory

Striking gossamer threads, thrumming with silvery sound.

Alas, hammers thrash a misplaced chord: dissonance amplified by thousands.

As the staff unravels in dreadful cacophony,
Blotches of gibberish bleed on the page;

Begging for deliverance with anguished cries.

...

The smudged inkblots dissolve, the flickering cursor

Swiftly felling them without a trace of pity.

The doldrums stare back at me, while phantasms of what stood before

Insidiously whisper I have no other way:

Lest I cement my part on the world's stage of speech;

A tongue-tied freak to be gawked at, agape and grotesque.

...

My eyes squeeze shut to the coalescing vision, blind to the gloom and murk of a cave.

My hand scrabbles across stone, desperate to grasp something.

My jawline strains against sewn lips, eyes weeping as the barbs bite into flesh,

Copper ichor welling where my tongue once lay.

Incoherent phrases throb palpably within my skull,

As wraiths hungrily approach, for this shame is their feast.

...

I raggedly exhale, and examine my empty hand.

Barely callused, a thousand faint creases overlapping worn ligaments.

Tendons stretch, rupturing fissures within the palm,

Before fastening into knuckles,
Nails digging into soft flesh.

A pleasant tautness.

...

From the center of a verdant clearing, the dewfall ripples a surface of glass.

Orchestras of chroma spring forth; vibrant, beautiful colors.

Valleys of sound dip from stoic silence to wondrous proclamation.

Words are traded in commerce above,

Numbers are mined in the depths below,

Its majesty draws me closer, but I cannot hide here for long.

...

I open my eyes to a curious sight,

For what was once bare is now filled to the brim.

Despite the bands of sun having waned to dark, I tick away;

Relishing the neat, dark limbs peppering the page,

Finishing up, with still much left to say.

Will it suffice for the time being? Will they understand one day?

...

Perhaps."""
